# ✨Bash Script✨

## Description
we are creating a bash script that read source file and do some operations on it

## Requirements
- linux OS 
- vim editor

## Walking through
We can discuss our solution through 3 steps:

1. create sourse file
2. create bash file 
3. write the script 

## 1- Create source file

take the data and write it into file

## 2- Create bash file

vim new empty file and write on it then change the permision for this file to give user excute permision

## 3- Write the script

the script will be ttached in the repo

## NOTES 

there will be two file the first file meets the requirment in the task excatly called(task1.sh)
the seconed file called(task2.sh) is my point of view to solve this task and reduce the CPU itilization 

## Testing Service

we run the command (./task1.sh) to show the output and make sure the it meets the requirment output should be:
       325 of john@domain.com is odd number
       131 of jane@domain.com is odd number
